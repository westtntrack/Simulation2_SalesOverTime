The overall task is to determine challenges that may have contributed to a downturn in sales in 2014 from healthy sales in years 2012 and 2013. The initial task is to look at the following:

1.	Total Sales over time
2.	Sales by product category to analyze products that are more popular or offer higher margins.
3.	Sales by region to determine if there are problems in specific geographic areas.
4.	Customer Acquisition Rate per customer and region.
5.	Average Order Value.

Adventure Works Sales Over Time Key Insights:

1.	For Total Sales over time, visual shows total sales over time from what looks like the first quarter with sales in 2011 to the last quarter with sales in 2014. Sales trends show growth through 2013 and drop off in Q1 and Q2 in 2014.
2.	Sales by product category breaks down lifetime sales for each Category and Sub-Category. Looking at the visuals, produce the highest revenue and are likely the highest priced items sold via stores and online. They are driving sales and further analysis need to be made on region sales of bikes.
3.	Sales by Country/Territory will show total sales per region and country.
4.	Customer Acquisition Rate (Removed for later due to time constraints)
5.	When looking at Average Order Value, 2014 shows number of sales trending upwards. If Q1 and Q2 were the only numbers reported, however, the value of each order dropped dramatically. 
Due to the above analysis, my findings will show that bike sales likely dropped off in Q1 and Q2 for 2014 since the average order value dropped dramatically. Accessories, Clothing, and Components produced higher sales in those months, likely dropping bikes from the driving force of the company.
